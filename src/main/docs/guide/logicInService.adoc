Although the previous example is valid, usually you don't want to put your business logic in a Job. A better approach is to create an additional service which the `JobService` invokes. This approach decouples your business logic from the scheduling logic. Moreover, it facilities testing and maintenance. Let's see an example:

Create the following service:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/EmailService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/EmailService.groovy[]
----

And then the job:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/DailyEmailJobService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/DailyEmailJobService.groovy[tag=dailyEmailJobService]
----
<1> Force service to initialize, without forcing the service to be initialized the jobs will not execute
<2> Inject the service
<3> Call it
<4> Trigger the job once a day at 04:30 AM


Cron notation is often confusing. To have more advanced control over job execution it is possible to implement a TaskScheduler.
