To get started using more advance scheduling techniques first we need to create and register a TaskScheduler bean.

Create the following configuration file containing a new task scheduler bean

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/SchedulingConfiguration.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/demo/SchedulingConfiguration.groovy[]
----
<1> Make your config discoverable
<2> All related threads will be prefixed with ThreadPoolTaskScheduler

If you wish to allow for concurrent execution set the thread pools size ex. `threadPoolTaskScheduler.setPoolSize(5)`

NOTE: By default ThreadPoolTaskScheduler only has a single thread available for execution, which means tasks will not execute concurrently

Now configure your app to automatically discover the new configuration so your new bean will work with standard
Grails dependency injection

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/init/demo/Application.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/init/demo/Application.groovy[]
----
<1> Enable discovery of additional configuration files. You may also use Spring `@EnableScheduling` here to trigger scheduling.
