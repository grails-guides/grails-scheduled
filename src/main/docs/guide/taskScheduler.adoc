To get started using more advance scheduling techniques first we need to create and register a TaskScheduler bean.

Create the following bean

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/ThreadPoolTaskSchedulerBean.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/demo/ThreadPoolTaskSchedulerBean.groovy[]
----
<1> ThreadPoolTaskScheduler can execute tasks asynchronously based on the number of threads configured
<2> All related threads will be prefixed with ThreadPoolTaskScheduler

Make your new bean work with standard Grails dependency injection

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy[]
----
