To get started using more advance scheduling techniques first we need to create and register a TaskScheduler bean.

Create the following bean

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/ThreadPoolTaskSchedulerBean.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/demo/ThreadPoolTaskSchedulerBean.groovy[]
----
<1> All related threads will be prefixed with ThreadPoolTaskScheduler

If you wish to allow for concurrent execution set the thread pools size ex. `threadPoolTaskScheduler.setPoolSize(5)`

NOTE: By default ThreadPoolTaskScheduler only has a single thread available for execution, which means tasks will not execute concurrently

Now make your new bean work with standard Grails dependency injection

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy[]
----
