In our previous cron example we did mention that many times cron can be confusing and is not intuitive. To alleviate some
of that confusion here is the previous cron configuration written using the TaskScheduler

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/todayat/DailyMailJobService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/todayat/DailyMailJobService.groovy[tag=dailyEmailJobService]
----
<1> Dependency injection of our TaskScheduler bean
<2> Dependency injection of emailService
<3> Calculate start time
<4> Calculate repeat interval
<5> Schedule task with start time and repeat interval

Once you have written your schedule using TaskScheduler, register the job in bootstrap.

.grails-app/init/demo/BootStrap.groovy
